# Multithreading application with JavaFX
My course project

This is my course project, which I made at the 4th course of the University.
The application simulates the work of the hospital, namely: the patient comes to the doctor, receives a referral to one of the other three doctors, visits him and leaves the hospital. Doctors and patients implemented as a separate thread. Visualization was done with javaFX.
